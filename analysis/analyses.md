# Prediction Model Comparison Analysis

This document summarizes the comparison between previous and current prediction models for both duration and occupancy.

## 1. What Changed Between Previous and Current Predictions

### Duration Predictions:
- **Mean Change**: The average predicted duration increased slightly by about 0.5 minutes (from 78.12 to 78.60 minutes).
- **Variance Change**: The current model shows significantly more variance in its predictions (std dev increased from 12.33 to 16.87).
- **Range Expansion**: The maximum predicted duration increased dramatically from 132.6 minutes to 265.9 minutes, indicating the new model is willing to predict much longer sessions in certain cases.
- **Significant Changes**: 17.6% of predictions changed by more than 15 minutes between models.
- **Moderate Correlation**: The correlation between old and new predictions is 0.60, suggesting significant changes in individual predictions while maintaining similar overall patterns.

### Occupancy Predictions:
- **Mean Change**: The average predicted occupancy decreased by 1.7 people (from 13.4 to 11.7 people).
- **Variance Change**: The current model shows much higher variance (std dev increased from 3.43 to 4.71).
- **Range Expansion**: The maximum predicted occupancy doubled from 19 to 38 people.
- **Significant Changes**: A third (33.6%) of predictions changed by more than 3 people.
- **Moderate Correlation**: The correlation between old and new predictions is 0.66.

## 2. Distribution Comparison

### Duration Distributions:
- The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirms the distributions are statistically different (p-value < 0.05).
- The current model produces a wider range of predictions with more extreme values, especially on the upper end.
- While the mean is similar, the current model's distribution has heavier tails.

### Occupancy Distributions:
- The distributions are significantly different (KS statistic of 0.28, much higher than duration).
- The current model tends to predict lower occupancy overall, with a shift in the distribution toward lower values.
- The current distribution has a longer right tail with some very high predictions that weren't present in the previous model.

## 3. Which Model is Better?

Without ground truth data, it's challenging to definitively state which model is better, but we can make informed assessments:

### Duration Model:
- **Greater Flexibility**: The increased variance suggests the current model might be better at distinguishing between different scenarios rather than defaulting to average values.
- **More Realistic Range**: If actual durations vary widely, the broader range of predictions may better reflect reality.
- **Risk of Extremes**: The very high maximum predictions (up to 265 minutes) need validation against real data to ensure they're not outliers.

### Occupancy Model:
- **Potentially More Conservative**: The lower average occupancy predictions might lead to more efficient resource allocation if previous predictions were too high.
- **Higher Variance**: Like the duration model, this suggests better discrimination between different scenarios.
- **Significant Shift**: The substantial shift in distribution (33.6% of predictions changing significantly) requires validation against ground truth to confirm improvement.

## 4. Additional Insights

1. **Model Consistency**: Both models show moderate correlation with their predecessors (0.60-0.65), suggesting evolution rather than complete replacement.

2. **Different Approach to Extremes**:
   - The current duration model is more willing to predict very long sessions
   - The current occupancy model predicts a wider range of values, both lower and higher than before

3. **Potential Trade-offs**:
   - The increased variance in both models might represent better sensitivity to input features
   - However, this could also indicate more noise in the predictions

4. **Practical Implications**:
   - Resource planning might need adjustment with the new occupancy predictions being lower on average
   - The wider range of duration predictions might require more flexible scheduling

## 5. Statistics Summary

### Duration Prediction Statistics

## Conclusion

The current models represent a significant change in prediction patterns compared to the previous versions. The most notable differences are:

1. Duration predictions now show greater variance with similar mean values
2. Occupancy predictions have shifted downward with increased variance
3. Both models seem to be less conservative in predicting extreme values

To definitively determine which model is better, you would need to:
- Compare predictions against actual outcomes (ground truth)
- Evaluate model performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, etc.) on a test set
- Consider the business impact of the prediction changes (e.g., resource allocation, scheduling efficiency)

Without these validation steps, the most we can say is that the current models appear to capture more variety in the underlying patterns, but this increased flexibility needs to be validated against actual outcomes.
