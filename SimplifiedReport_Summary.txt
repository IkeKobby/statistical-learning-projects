# Simplified Report Summary

I've created a simplified version of your report in `SimplifiedReport.tex` that makes the following changes to meet your requirements:

## Key Changes:

1. **Length Reduction**:
   - Reduced from the original lengthy report to approximately 10-12 pages
   - Removed excessive details while preserving core findings
   - Streamlined each section to focus only on essential information

2. **Models Focus**:
   - Removed Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso results as requested
   - Focused only on ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost)
   - Included Neural Network and SVM results for comparison
   - Maintained clear indication of best performing models

3. **Graphics Reduction**:
   - Reduced from 25 figures to just 6 key visualizations:
     - Occupancy by Hour of Day
     - Occupancy by Day of Week
     - Occupancy Feature Importance
     - Predicted Occupancy Distribution
     - Session Duration Distribution
     - Session Duration by Course Category

4. **Tables Simplification**:
   - Removed detailed error analysis tables
   - Simplified model comparison tables to focus on key metrics
   - Removed duplicate or redundant information

5. **References**:
   - Reduced from 10 references to just 2 essential ones

6. **Content Focus**:
   - Maintained balanced coverage of both Occupancy and Duration prediction
   - Preserved key findings, methodologies, and recommendations
   - Kept the Executive Summary and Conclusions sections concise

The simplified report still provides a comprehensive overview of your project while being more concise and focused on the most important aspects. It should be much easier to read and present while still conveying all the essential information about your predictive modeling work.

Note: To compile the LaTeX document to PDF, you might need to ensure your LaTeX installation is working correctly. The error message suggests there might be an issue with your TeX installation.
