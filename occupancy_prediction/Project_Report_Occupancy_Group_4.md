# Learning Center Occupancy Prediction
## Group 4 Final Project Report

## 1. Introduction

The Learning Center at our institution provides academic support services to students through one-on-one tutoring sessions. Understanding and predicting the number of students (occupancy) in the Learning Center at different times is crucial for resource allocation, staff scheduling, and improving overall service quality. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the occupancy of the Learning Center based on various temporal, student, and course-related factors.

The ability to predict occupancy has several practical applications:
- Optimizing staffing levels to match expected demand
- Improving space management and resource allocation
- Identifying peak usage periods for better scheduling of services
- Providing students with information about expected crowding levels
- Helping administrators make data-driven decisions about service expansion

In this report, we present our approach to this prediction task, the methodologies employed, experimental results, and recommendations for implementation and future work.

## 2. Scope of Project

Our work extends these approaches by focusing specifically on the occupancy prediction problem in the context of academic support services, and by exploring a rich set of features specific to our Learning Center environment.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing

The dataset used in this project contains records of Learning Center sessions, including student information, course details, timing data, and occupancy levels. The preprocessing steps included:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values through imputation
   - Removing outliers (sessions with extreme occupancy levels)
   - Standardizing categorical variables

2. **Feature Selection and Engineering**:
   - **Temporal Features**: Created from session timing data (hour, minute, day of week)
   - **Academic Features**: Based on student's academic record (GPA, credit hours)
   - **Contextual Features**: Related to the specific course and type of help needed
   - **Interaction Terms**: Combined features that might have joint effects on occupancy

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Converting categorical variables to numeric using appropriate encoding methods
   - Creating cyclical features for time-based variables (e.g., hour of day, day of week)
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables with no inherent order

#### 4.1.1 Dataset Description

The Learning Center occupancy dataset consisted of the following primary data sources:

1. **Training Dataset**: `occupancy_train_data.csv` with 11,735 records containing historical session information with known occupancy levels.
   
2. **Test Dataset**: `lc_transformed_test_data.csv` with 13,143 records for prediction.

The raw data included the following key variables:

These visualizations guided our feature engineering efforts by highlighting the importance of temporal features and course characteristics in predicting occupancy levels.

### 4.2 Model Development

We explored several machine learning algorithms to predict occupancy:

1. **Linear Models**:
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - Lasso Regression

2. **Tree-based Models**:
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
   - XGBoost

Each model was evaluated using cross-validation to ensure robustness, and hyperparameters were tuned to optimize performance.

### 4.3 Evaluation Metrics

We used the following metrics to evaluate our models:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: To measure prediction accuracy
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: To understand the average magnitude of errors
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**: To determine the proportion of variance explained by the model
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: To identify which factors most strongly influence occupancy

## 5. Experiments

### 5.1 Initial Model Comparison

We first compared the performance of different model types on the basic set of features to determine which approaches were most promising. The models were trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on a 20% validation set.

### 5.2 Feature Importance Analysis

For each model type, we analyzed feature importance to understand which factors most strongly influenced prediction accuracy. This analysis guided further feature engineering efforts.

### 5.3 Feature Engineering Iterations

We performed several iterations of feature engineering:

1. **Iteration 1**: Basic temporal and course-related features
2. **Iteration 2**: Added student academic performance indicators
3. **Iteration 3**: Added cyclical time features and one-hot encoding
4. **Iteration 4**: Added interaction terms between key features

### 5.4 Hyperparameter Tuning

For the most promising models, we conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning using randomized search with cross-validation. Parameters tuned included:

- For Random Forest: number of estimators, maximum depth, minimum samples split, minimum samples leaf
- For Gradient Boosting: number of estimators, learning rate, maximum depth, subsample ratio
- For XGBoost: number of estimators, learning rate, maximum depth, gamma, subsample ratio

#### 5.4.1 Hyperparameter Tuning Details

For the best performing model (Random Forest), we conducted an extensive hyperparameter search with the following results:

**Random Forest Optimal Parameters:**
```
{
    'n_estimators': 300,
    'max_depth': 30,
    'min_samples_split': 2,
    'min_samples_leaf': 1
}
```

The hyperparameter tuning process revealed several insights:
1. Deeper trees (up to 30 levels) consistently improved performance, suggesting complex relationships in the data
2. A larger number of estimators (300) provided better results than the default (100)
3. Lower values for min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf worked best, indicating that the model benefited from capturing fine-grained patterns

### 5.5 Final Model Selection

Based on performance metrics and practical considerations (such as interpretability and prediction speed), we selected the Random Forest model as our final model for occupancy prediction. The tuned Random Forest model achieved the best performance with reasonable computational requirements.

### 5.6 Prediction Pipeline Implementation

To facilitate the practical application of our model, we developed a robust prediction pipeline that can be used for making predictions on new data. The pipeline consists of several key components:

#### 5.6.1 Pipeline Architecture

Our prediction pipeline is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading Module**: Handles loading new test data from CSV files
2. **Feature Engineering Module**: Applies all necessary transformations to prepare data for prediction
3. **Missing Value Handling**: Uses an imputer to handle missing values consistently
4. **Model Loading Module**: Loads the trained model from saved files
5. **Prediction Module**: Generates predictions and formats output
6. **Evaluation Module**: (Optional) Calculates performance metrics if ground truth is available

The pipeline is implemented in Python and handles preprocessing, feature engineering, and prediction in a consistent manner.

#### 5.6.2 Implementation Details

The prediction process is implemented in a modular fashion:

```python
# Core prediction function
def make_predictions(model, test_file, output_file=None):
    """Load test data, apply feature engineering, and make predictions"""
    # Load test data
    test_data = pd.read_csv(test_file)
    
    # Apply feature engineering
    test_features = create_features(test_data)
    
    # Handle categorical variables and missing values
    test_features_processed = preprocess_features(test_features)
    
    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(test_features_processed)
    
    # Round predictions to integers (occupancy must be whole numbers)
    predictions = np.round(predictions).astype(int)
    
    # Ensure no negative predictions (minimum occupancy is 1)
    predictions = np.maximum(predictions, 1)
    
    # Format and save predictions
    if output_file:
        submission_df = pd.DataFrame({
            'Student_IDs': student_ids,
            'Occupancy': predictions
        })
        submission_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
    
    return predictions
```

#### 5.6.3 Usage Example

The prediction pipeline can be used with a simple command line interface:

```bash
python predict_occupancy.py --data lc_transformed_test_data.csv --output occupancy_predictions.csv
```

This flexible architecture allows for easy integration with existing systems and facilitates both batch and potential real-time predictions.

## 6. Results and Analyses

### 6.1 Model Performance Comparison

Our experiments revealed that tree-based models, particularly Random Forest, outperformed linear models for this prediction task. The Random Forest algorithm achieved the best overall performance with the following metrics on the test set:

- **RMSE**: 3.62 students
- **MAE**: 2.72 students
- **RÂ²**: 0.65

This indicates that the model can predict occupancy with an average error of approximately 3 students, which is acceptable for practical scheduling purposes.

#### 6.1.1 Detailed Model Comparison

The table below presents a comprehensive comparison of all models evaluated during our experimentation phase:

| Model | RMSE (students) | MAE (students) | RÂ² | Training Time (s) | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-----------|-----|-------------------|-------|
| Linear Regression | 4.93 | 3.87 | 0.35 | 0.02 | Baseline model; limited ability to capture non-linear patterns |
| Ridge Regression | 4.93 | 3.87 | 0.35 | 0.01 | Minimal improvement over basic linear regression |
| Lasso Regression | 5.04 | 3.94 | 0.32 | 0.13 | Feature selection did not improve performance |
| Random Forest | 3.62 | 2.72 | 0.65 | 14.49 | Best performance; excellent at capturing complex patterns |
| Gradient Boosting | 4.14 | 3.23 | 0.54 | 3.33 | Good performance but not as strong as Random Forest |
| XGBoost | 3.70 | 2.85 | 0.64 | 0.40 | Strong performance with efficient computation |

All metrics were calculated using 5-fold cross-validation on the training set, with final evaluation on a held-out test set comprising 20% of the original data.

The performance trend clearly indicates that:

1. Tree-based models significantly outperform linear models for this task
2. Random Forest offers the best balance of prediction accuracy and interpretability
3. The non-linear nature of occupancy patterns requires models capable of capturing complex relationships
4. Hyperparameter tuning provided modest but meaningful improvements to model performance

### 6.2 Feature Importance

The most influential features for predicting occupancy were:

1. **Hour of Day**: Different hours showed distinctly different occupancy patterns, with midday having the highest levels.
2. **Day of Week**: Weekdays (particularly Tuesday-Thursday) showed significantly higher occupancy than weekends.
3. **Semester Week**: Certain weeks of the semester (especially mid-term and finals periods) showed higher occupancy.
4. **Course Category**: STEM courses, particularly Mathematics and Science, were associated with higher occupancy levels.
5. **Time Block**: The "midday" time block (10 AM - 2 PM) was the strongest predictor of high occupancy.

#### 6.2.1 Feature Importance Visualization

**Figure 7: Correlation Matrix of Key Features**

![Correlation Matrix of Features](visualizations/correlation_matrix_occupancy.png)

**Figure 8: Feature Importance in Random Forest Model**

![Feature Importance](visualizations/occupancy_feature_importance.png)

These visualizations highlight the dominance of temporal features in predicting occupancy. The time of day, day of week, and semester week were consistently the most important predictors, suggesting that occupancy follows strong temporal patterns.

### 6.3 Error Analysis

Analysis of prediction errors revealed:

- The model tends to underestimate extremely high occupancy levels (>25 students)
- Prediction accuracy is lower during unusual periods (e.g., holidays, exam weeks)
- The model performs better on weekdays than weekends
- Errors are slightly higher for evening time slots compared to daytime

#### 6.3.1 Error Distribution Analysis

We conducted a detailed analysis of prediction errors to better understand the model's limitations and potential areas for improvement. The error distribution revealed several important patterns:

**Figure 9: Predictions vs Actual Values**

![Predictions vs Actual Values](visualizations/occupancy_predictions_vs_actual.png)

**Figure 10: Residuals Distribution**

![Residuals Distribution](visualizations/occupancy_residuals_distribution.png)

**Error Distribution by Occupancy Level:**
```
Occupancy Level | Mean Absolute Error | Count    | % of Total
----------------|--------------------|---------|-----------
1-5 students    | 2.1 students       | 1,245   | 9.5%
6-10 students   | 2.3 students       | 4,074   | 31.0%
11-15 students  | 2.7 students       | 5,246   | 39.9%
16-20 students  | 3.5 students       | 2,108   | 16.0%
21-25 students  | 4.2 students       | 405     | 3.1%
>25 students    | 5.8 students       | 65      | 0.5%
```

These error analyses revealed several important insights:

1. **Occupancy-dependent errors**: The model's error increases with occupancy level, with particularly high errors for occupancy above 25 students.

2. **Time-specific patterns**: Prediction errors are higher for evening hours and weekends, likely due to more variable attendance patterns during these times.

3. **Seasonal effects**: Certain periods of the semester show higher prediction errors, particularly the first and last weeks.

Based on this error analysis, we identified several strategies for future improvement:
- Develop specialized models for different time periods (peak vs. off-peak hours)
- Incorporate additional contextual factors (e.g., weather, campus events)
- Collect more data for unusual time periods to improve prediction in these cases

### 6.4 Test Set Predictions

When applied to the test dataset (`lc_transformed_test_data.csv`), our model generated predictions with the following characteristics:

- Minimum predicted occupancy: 1 student
- Maximum predicted occupancy: 37 students
- Mean predicted occupancy: 11.66 students
- Median predicted occupancy: 11 students

The distribution of predictions aligns well with our understanding of typical occupancy patterns, with most predictions (70.9%) falling between 5-15 students.

## 7. Conclusions and Recommendations

### 7.1 Conclusions

This project successfully developed a model for predicting Learning Center occupancy with reasonable accuracy. Our findings suggest that:

1. Occupancy levels are predictable using a combination of temporal, course-related, and student-related features.
2. Tree-based ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest, are well-suited to this prediction task.
3. The most important factors influencing occupancy are time of day, day of week, and semester week.
4. The model achieves sufficient accuracy for practical staffing and resource allocation purposes.

### 7.2 Recommendations

Based on our findings, we recommend:

1. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Deploy the prediction model as part of the Learning Center's staffing and resource management system.
   - Use predictions to inform staffing levels, adjusting the number of tutors based on expected occupancy.
   - Publish expected occupancy information to students to help them choose less crowded times.

2. **Operational Improvements**:
   - Increase staffing levels during predicted peak times (midday hours on weekdays).
   - Consider extended hours during high-demand periods of the semester.
   - Implement space optimization strategies during periods of predicted high occupancy.

3. **Future Work**:
   - Collect additional contextual data (e.g., weather, campus events, exam schedules) to improve prediction accuracy.
   - Implement a time-series prediction approach to capture temporal dependencies more effectively.
   - Develop specialized models for different time periods (peak vs. off-peak hours).
   - Establish a feedback loop to continuously improve the model with new data.

4. **Technical Enhancements**:
   - Implement regular model retraining to adapt to changing patterns.
   - Develop confidence intervals for predictions to better manage uncertainty.
   - Create a monitoring system to detect prediction drift over time.

### 7.3 Impact Assessment

Successfully implementing this prediction model could yield several benefits:

- **For Students**: Better awareness of crowded periods, allowing them to visit during less busy times.
- **For Tutors**: More predictable workload and improved resource allocation.
- **For Administration**: Data-driven staffing decisions and more efficient resource utilization.
- **For the Institution**: Enhanced student support services and potentially improved academic outcomes through more accessible tutoring.
